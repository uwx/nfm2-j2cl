/**
 * The <code>FontMetrics</code> class defines a font metrics object, which
 * encapsulates information about the rendering of a particular font on a
 * particular screen.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note to subclassers</b>: Since many of these methods form closed,
 * mutually recursive loops, you must take care that you implement
 * at least one of the methods in each such loop to prevent
 * infinite recursion when your subclass is used.
 * In particular, the following is the minimal suggested set of methods
 * to override in order to ensure correctness and prevent infinite
 * recursion (though other subsets are equally feasible):
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getAscent()}
 * <li>{@link #getLeading()}
 * <li>{@link #getMaxAdvance()}
 * <li>{@link #charWidth(char)}
 * <li>{@link #charsWidth(char[], int, int)}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/FontMetrics-1.gif" alt="The letter 'p' showing its 'reference point'"
 * style="border:15px; float:right; margin: 7px 10px;">
 * Note that the implementations of these methods are
 * inefficient, so they are usually overridden with more efficient
 * toolkit-specific implementations.
 * <p>
 * When an application asks to place a character at the position
 * (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>), the character is placed so that its
 * reference point (shown as the dot in the accompanying image) is
 * put at that position. The reference point specifies a horizontal
 * line called the <i>baseline</i> of the character. In normal
 * printing, the baselines of characters should align.
 * <p>
 * In addition, every character in a font has an <i>ascent</i>, a
 * <i>descent</i>, and an <i>advance width</i>. The ascent is the
 * amount by which the character ascends above the baseline. The
 * descent is the amount by which the character descends below the
 * baseline. The advance width indicates the position at which AWT
 * should place the next character.
 * <p>
 * An array of characters or a string can also have an ascent, a
 * descent, and an advance width. The ascent of the array is the
 * maximum ascent of any character in the array. The descent is the
 * maximum descent of any character in the array. The advance width
 * is the sum of the advance widths of each of the characters in the
 * character array.  The advance of a <code>String</code> is the
 * distance along the baseline of the <code>String</code>.  This
 * distance is the width that should be used for centering or
 * right-aligning the <code>String</code>.
 * <p>Note that the advance of a <code>String</code> is not necessarily
 * the sum of the advances of its characters measured in isolation
 * because the width of a character can vary depending on its context.
 * For example, in Arabic text, the shape of a character can change
 * in order to connect to other characters.  Also, in some scripts,
 * certain character sequences can be represented by a single shape,
 * called a <em>ligature</em>.  Measuring characters individually does
 * not account for these transformations.
 * <p>Font metrics are baseline-relative, meaning that they are
 * generally independent of the rotation applied to the font (modulo
 * possible grid hinting effects).  See {@link java.awt.Font Font}.
